### Nginx configuration for using Boost with Drupal. This
### configuration makes use of drush (http:///drupal.org/project/drush)
### for site maintenance and like tasks:
###
### 1. Run the cronjobs.
### 2. Run the DB and code updates: drush up or drush upc followed by
###    drush updb to run any DB updates required by the code upgrades
###    that were performed.
### 3. Disabling of xmlrpc.xml, install.php (needed only for
###    installing the site) and update.php: all updates are now
###    handled through drush.
